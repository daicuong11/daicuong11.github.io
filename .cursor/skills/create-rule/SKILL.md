# Creating Cursor Rules

Create project rules in `.cursor/rules/` to provide persistent context for the AI agent.

## Gather Requirements

Before creating a rule, determine:

1. **Purpose**: What should this rule enforce or teach?
2. **Scope**: Should it always apply, or only for specific files?
3. **File patterns**: If file-specific, which glob patterns?

### Inferring from Context

If you have previous conversation context, infer rules from what was discussed. You can create multiple rules if the conversation covers distinct topics or patterns. Don't ask redundant questions if the context already provides the answers.

### Required Questions

If the user hasn't specified scope, ask:
- "Should this rule always apply, or only when working with specific files?"

If they mentioned specific files and haven't provided concrete patterns, ask:
- "Which file patterns should this rule apply to?" (e.g., `**/*.ts`, `backend/**/*.py`)

It's very important that we get clarity on the file patterns.

Use the AskQuestion tool when available to gather this efficiently.

## Rule File Format

Rules are `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` with YAML frontmatter:

```
.cursor/rules/
  typescript-standards.mdc
  react-patterns.mdc
  api-conventions.mdc
```

### File Structure

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this rule does
globs: **/*.ts  # File pattern for file-specific rules
alwaysApply: false  # Set to true if rule should always apply
---

# Rule Title

Your rule content here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `description` | string | What the rule does (shown in rule picker) |
| `globs` | string | File pattern - rule applies when matching files are open |
| `alwaysApply` | boolean | If true, applies to every session |

---

## Rule Configurations

### Always Apply

For universal standards that should apply to every conversation:

```yaml
---
description: Core coding standards for the project
alwaysApply: true
---
```

### Apply to Specific Files

For rules that apply when working with certain file types:

```yaml
---
description: TypeScript conventions for this project
globs: **/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---
```

---

## Best Practices

### Keep Rules Concise

- **Under 50 lines**: Rules should be concise and to the point
- **One concern per rule**: Split large rules into focused pieces
- **Actionable**: Write like clear internal docs
- **Concrete examples**: Ideally provide concrete examples of how to fix issues

---

## Example Rules

### TypeScript Standards

```markdown
---
description: TypeScript coding standards
globs: **/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---

# Error Handling

\`\`\`typescript
// ❌ BAD
try {
  await fetchData();
} catch (e) {}

// ✅ GOOD
try {
  await fetchData();
} catch (e) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch', { error: e });
  throw new DataFetchError('Unable to retrieve data', { cause: e });
}
\`\`\`
```

### React Patterns

```markdown
---
description: React component patterns
globs: **/*.tsx
alwaysApply: false
---

# React Patterns

- Use functional components
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic
- Colocate styles with components
```

---

## Linking Rules to Commands and Skills

When you create a **rule** that supports or is used by a **command** (e.g. a convention that applies when the user runs a slash command), the rule must **link** to that command and to the command’s skill so the agent can connect them.

**Requirement**: In the rule body, add a **Related** (or **Links**) section at the end with:

- **Command**: The slash command that uses this rule — `.cursor/commands/{command-name}.md` (e.g. `.cursor/commands/task.md`).
- **Skill** (if any): The skill that implements the command workflow — `.cursor/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` (e.g. `.cursor/skills/task/SKILL.md`).

**Example** (rule used by `/task`):

```markdown
## Related

- **Command**: `.cursor/commands/task.md` — this rule applies when the user runs `/task`.
- **Skill**: `.cursor/skills/task/SKILL.md` — workflow that loads this rule during execution.
```

If the rule is generic (e.g. global-rules) and not tied to a single command, you may instead reference which commands or skills typically use it (e.g. "Used by task, create-config-for-this-project, and project-specific rules").

## Checklist

- [ ] File is `.mdc` format in `.cursor/rules/`
- [ ] Frontmatter configured correctly
- [ ] Content under 500 lines
- [ ] Includes concrete examples
- [ ] If the rule is used by a command: body includes a **Related** section linking to that command and its skill (see "Linking Rules to Commands and Skills" above).
